# 24Slides test task

The purpose of this repo is to give you an environment with a bunch of problems to solve and stuff to improve, so we can save time setting up the project from scratch and get closer to the intersting stuff. :)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Launch dev mode `npm run dev`
3. Have a look on what is in browser :)
4. Check the code and TODOs scattered around it
5. Do tasks in pages
6. Fix TODOs
7. Implement [the last task](https://github.com/24Slides/test-annotations) in this repository as a separate route

## What's next?

1. Create a private fork of this repository
2. Upload changes to a separate branch and make a PR in your private fork
3. Invite [@non25](https://github.com/non25) and [@brezzhnev](https://github.com/brezzhnev) to the private repo
4. Put them on code review
5. Profit :)

## Hints in no particular order

- Feel free to change anything you want until it looks good for you :)
- Use concise and to the point commit messages like "Fix re-renders in todo list"
- Focus on quality of solutions
